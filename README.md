This is one of the many projects I completed as a student at [Telegraph Academy](http://telegraphacademy.com).

The name of this app is Inspire.

Inspire is a quote random quote generator.  It will access the TheySaidSo Famous Quotes API provided from theysaidso.com.

The app will allow users to select from 3 different categories of quotes:
  -- inspirational, wise, and hilarious type quotes

Angular will be used to design the front end.
Angular will also be used to send the GET and POST requests to the API
